Four models made up this line of computers, and while Apple focused predominantly on print advertisements for its marketing campaign, it did run a series of television spots touting, primarily, the computer's benefits to students and the education market.\\n\nDid you know that before he was dancing with wolves and searching for dry land, Kevin Costner was pimping for Apple? Before the world met the Macintosh, Costner starred in this classic 1982 ad for the Apple Lisa.\\n\nHands-down the most iconic Apple ad of all time, the \"1984\" commercial aired only once, during the third quarter of Super Bowl XVIII. The award-winning spot was directed by Ridley Scott (who had an unheard of $900,000 budget) and introduced the world to Apple's Macintosh computer.\\nThe 1984 ad is now considered one of the most memorable and successful commercials of all time, a masterpiece in American advertising, and a continued object of study for marketing and cultural scholars.\\n\nBefore there were iPhones and iPads, there was Newton. While the Apple Newton is widely considered a commercial failure, Apple's PDA stuck around through at least 1997 and elements of its software (like its handwriting recognition technology) still live on in other Apple products.\\n\nApple launched its \"Think Different\" campaign in 1997. The original \"Crazy Ones\" TV commercial was a one minute, black and white advertisement featuring historical figures such as Albert Einstein, Martin Luther King, Jr., John Lennon, Thomas Edison, Mahatma Gandhi, Amelia Earheart, Alfred Hitchcock, Jim Henson, Frank Lloyd Wright, and Pablo Picasso.\\nA truncated version of the \"Crazy Ones\" commercial featured Jerry Seinfeld and aired just once, during his show's series finale.\\n\nWhen it launched the original iMac in 1998, Apple avoided the boring beige that plagued PCs and rolled out a line of all-in-one computers available in more than a dozen different colors.\\nThe original iMac came in \"Bondi blue,\" but Apple soon replaced it with \"flavors\" like blueberry, strawberry, tangerine, grape, and lime. Later releases introduced options like graphite, ruby, sage, snow, indigo, and patterns including \"Blue Dalmatian,\" and \"Flower Power.\"\\n\nWhile everyone was panicking about Y2K, Apple was playing it cool. This 1999 Super Bowl ad touted the Mac's immunity to Y2K, and while that whole \"worldwide, apocalyptic computer meltdown\" thing turned out to be a major bust, the ad does feature a pretty cool cameo from everyone's favorite computer gone bad. 'Sup, HAL?\\n\nAh, the inaugural iPod commercial. Featuring the Propellerheads' \"Take California,\" this low-key ad was all about the music (and rightly so). Remember when iPods had monochrome screens, those old-fashioned scroll wheels, FireWire ports, and only enough space for 1,000 songs? We do! (And quite frankly, we kind of miss it.)\\n\nEllen Feiss became an Internet sensation when the then-14-year-old starred in Apple's 2002 \"Switch\" campaign. The series of TV spots, directed by Errol Morris, featured celebrities who had switched from PCs to Macs, including Yo-Yo Ma, Kelly Slater, Will Ferrell, and Tony Hawk.\\nIts minimalist and modern aesthetic made \"Switch\" an instant classic, and while the ads were phased out by 2003, elements of them would re-emerge in the 2006 \"Get a Mac\" campaign.\\n\nThe iMac finally got an upgrade in 2002. In addition to a faster G4 processor, the iMac got a design overhaul when Apple introduced this desk lamp-style \"New iMac.\"\\nOriginally featuring a 15\" LCD (Apple would later add a 17\" option) mounted to its CPU by an adjustable, pivoting arm and tray-loading SuperDrive, the New iMac was (and still is) a favorite among Apple design enthusiasts. The innovative design was featured in a short film produced by Pixar and this 2001 \"window shopping\" ad.\\n\nIt's hard to believe the \"Silhouette\" commercials have been around since 2003, but that's when Apple launched the ubiquitous ad campaign to promote its iPod line and then-new iTunes Music Store The original silhouette ad featured the Black Eyed Peas' \"Hey Mama.\" The graphics have since been improved and Apple now uses the ads for its iPod Shuffle and iPod Nano lines, too.\\nOther iPod + iTunes spots have included songs by U2, the Caesars, Daft Punk, the Gorillaz, Eminem, Wynton Marsalis, Wolfmother, Bob Dylan, the Ting Tings, Feist, and Coldplay.\\n\n2003 was truly the year of the iPod. With the launch of a redesigned, Windows-compatible iPod and iTunes 4 (which introduced the iTunes Music Store), Apple kicked off an aggressive marketing campaign, that included this partnership with Volkswagon.\\nPods Unite was a 2003 promotion that began by offering new Beetle sedan buyers a free iPod, but also laid the groundwork for iPod/automobile integration that Apple would later revisit with BMW.\\n\nIn 2003, Apple launched its then-revolutionary 12\" and 17\" PowerBooks. This TV spot, starring the diminutive Verne \"Mini-Me\" Troyer and the nearly-eight-foot-tall basketball pro Yao Ming garnered national attention when it aired during a post-Super Bowl episode of Alias.\\n\nWhen Apple announced the PowerMac G5 in 2003, who knew the record-breaking CPU would be the last of its kind? Apple touted the G5 as \"the fastest personal computer ever built,\" but it was discontinued in 2006 when Apple abandoned the PowerPC processor for an Intel chipset and replaced its PowerMac line with the unimpressively-named Mac Pro.\\n\nApple continued to hawk the iPod and its iTunes Music Store hard in 2004 when it partnered with Pepsi and punk-pop band Green Day for this much-hyped Super Bowl ad. The spot featured a cover of \"I Fought the Law\" and kicked off a promotion to give away 100 million free songs.\\nThe soda promotion fell a little flat â€” by April, Apple had only given away about 5 million free songs, but the sheer hype that had surrounded the Super Bowl spot the Pepsi promotion nonetheless ranks it among one of Apple's most memorable marketing moments.\\n\nApple continued to promote its music player business by teaming up with corporate partners. In 2004, it joined BMW in developing a system to more seamlessly integrate auto with audio.\\n\nStarring John Hodgman and Justin Long, the 2006 \"Get a Mac\" campaign was the successor to the earlier \"Switch\" ads.\\nThis set of spots won an EFFIE Award from the New York American Marketing Association in 2007 and have been re-dubbed and adapted for localities throughout the world. The music was composed by renowned composer (and lead Devo singer), Mark Mothersbaugh.\\n\nFor its British market, Apple recast the \"Get a Mac\" ads with David Mitchell and Robert Webb, a poular British comedy double act. Many of the American ads were reshot with new dialogue and slightly altered scenes and also featured new spots unique to the British campaign.\\n\nApple finally made its long-awaited foray into the mobile phone market in 2007. The iPhone's revolutionary touch technology wow'd customers, and in the lead up to its launch, Apple aired a series of \"How-To\" ads aimed at prepping the masses for the so-called Jesus Phone.\\n\nThe iPhone, of course, is still going strong. Apple launched an iPhone App Store in 2008, which increased the device's functionality exponentially and gave Apple even more selling points that it's latched onto and refuses to let us forget about with its ubiquitous (and obnoxious) \"There's an App for That\" ads.\\n\nThe iPad, Apple's long-rumored (re-)entry into the tablet computer market, hit stores in 2010. Apple launched this iPhone-style spot (featuring the Blue Van's \"There Goes My Love\") during the 82nd Academy Awards."}

Why are the judges the way they are? Why do they say such dumb things?\\nFirst it must be mentioned that Harry Connick Jr. was a terrific mentor. Perhaps the best I've seen? It was great when little Aaron \"I Was Negative Four When When Harry Met Sally Came Out\" Kelly came in for his session and Connick actually gave him, like, musical advice and his little easter egg brain blew out the back of his skull. \"Mister is... teaching Aaron? Aaron does not know teaching before...\" I'm sure former mentor Miley Stinkvirus was watching somewhere and took a long pull on her Kool extra-long and said \"I was better than that, whatever, I've got a fake Australian boyfriend and what does Connick got, huh? Nothin'. Connick's got nothin'. Hey, Lopita, gemme my Funyuns, will ya?\"\\nSo that was good! It was good that the kids had a seriously competent mentor this week, because the judges just sucked disco balls. They don't know what the heck they're talkin' about half the time do they? Ellen's off making Connick jokes, Simon's gently rubbing Frank Sinatra's snot rag on his cheek, and Randy's busy plotting his next campaign against Mario and the toadstool peoples. Kara, bizarrely, has said some competent things this season, which makes me sad and want to tear at my face with my claws, because no one is ever supposed to agree with Kara, never ever, it is against God's law, a plague on nature. I think I've been watching this show for too long. Isn't it funny how weird and feral we all get at this point in the competition? We're starving and bug-ridden and we've already killed and eaten so many contestants that we can't even keep their names straight anymore. I probably want Crystal to go home tonight just so I can feel the pain and know that I'm still alive.\\nThe Good\nSpeaking of Crystal and stupid judges. She was great. Great! Loved her all dressed up and loved her soft, thoughtful \"Summer Wind.\" (I was pretty sure she was singing about her kid's dad. Did anyone else get that impression?) Ohhh sure her words were a leeetle swallowed in the beginning there, but whatever. But then judges were all \"Naw dawg, we like it when you blow, Boomboxer!\" Oddly, that's a direct quote... from Kara. They really didn't like it! I know they've been heaping praise on Blisterfix for weeks and weeks and they may feel like they have to temper it, but it just seemed unfair. She's leagues ahead of everyone else and should not be judged in the same way, at all. She should just win and the rest of the competish should be for second place.\\nSecond place should go to... your Cousin Phil Dweezy! Oh gosh he was good, huh? Boy oh boy. He's growing into a fine young man on that stage there, isn't he? Oh, and handsome! The girls are gonna love him. I tell ya, I haven't seen him look that handsome since his senior prom. Remember that? You were a little younger'n him, of course, but you remember we took you to your Aunt Karen's and Uncle Stan's and Phil was there in that tuxedo that he'd picked out himself. It was one of those, oh what do they call it, you know, like something from the '70s... Retro! That's it, right? It was a real retro kinda tuxedo and you know what, he pulled it off. He's always had that little spark of creativity in him I guess. Anyway, he was all excited because he was going to the prom with this real pretty girl, Allison Moorewood. You know, Nancy and Paul's daughter. Nancy and Paul from your Uncle Nick's wedding? You met them, you remember them. I don't know how he swung that date, but he did and he was real nervous about it, but he got himself dressed up real nice. I told your Aunt Karen, I said \"Keeks, I think you've got nothin' to worry about.\" Because, you know, that was after she'd found that marijuana joint in his drawer and he'd stopped doin' well in school and, I dunno. It was just a funk he was in, you know? But he bounced out of it some days, like that prom day. Which meant it wasn't a real deep kinda thing. It's just that age. Just kids that age bein' kids that age, I guess. It's a lot too handle, you know. Just lots of knew things coming atcha and new feelings and emotions and all that stuff. It's pretty exciting, but it can be pretty scary too. Anyway. That's what I thought about, Phil in his retro tuxedo standing outside Karen's house, when I saw your cousin up there last night, in that smart suit, looking very handsome and happy. It's amazing what people can do, isn't it. Just wonderful where people go.\\nThe Bad\nAieeeyarrghhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!! That is my primal scream for Michael Lynche. I feel like we need to make our own screaming now that the Siobhan Banshee is dead. (Damn you, Van Helsing!) I just cannot stand Michael Lynche! Here's something that we should talk about: wallet chains. Have ya noticed that Big Mike is always wearing a wallet chain? It's his \"thing.\" That and leather jackets with eagles emblazoned on the back. What is he, worried that Rickey Minor is going to pickpocket him? I mean, I've heard stories, but c'mon. You're on live TV! That's not how Rickey plays! Rickey will sneak up on you when you don't suspect it. And no dorky wallet chain is gonna stop him, either.\\nBut Mike's ridiculous fashion (that hat last night! beeelarrghhhhh!!!! and why was every boy wearing vests? why all the vests, everyone?) isn't the real crux of his problem. The real bloodroot of the issue is that he's just such a smug little bastard, isn't he? Just so terribly pleased with himself and his nonsense swagger and his \"check me out on iTunes\" like he's a real singing star or something. It's just so sad and pathetic because no, Michael Lynche. No. You are not going to be a huge star after this. You may get \"gigs\" (that is what musicians calls jobs, right? Gigs?) or maybe a random Broadway fill-in roles (Billy Flynn, 2014) but nothing to match the way you ham-hock it around that stage every week. C'mon man, you're embarrassing yourself. AND YOU TOO, JUDGES. Oh man did they weep and slop all over that performance last night. As if \"The Way You Look Tonight\" isn't a complete gimme. You can't sing \"The Way You Look Tonight\" and not have it be easy and nice. Because it is an easy and nice song. It wasn't some vocal Olympics that Big Mike had just won, but watching the judges you'd think he had just landed the last note on a broken ankle and then Bela Karolyi ran out and picked him up and there was much rejoicing and it was 1996 all over again and you still had time, still had time to do something with your life that didn't involve watching American Idol for paid work. You'd have thought Mark Spitz himself had descended from sex heaven, where he owns a condo, to bestow chest hair and gold medallions to the entire studio audience. They worshiped at the feet of Big Mike and he picked them all up in his bear hug and we said \"Groan\" â€” didn't actually groan, just said the word \"groan\" â€” and then it was time to go to bed. Oh Big Mike. You ruiner of evenings. You terrible fool. You are the wallet chain weighing down my heart.\\nBaby Genius\nTiny Aaron Kelly washed the gel out of his hair! Wasn't that clever of him? Mind you, he doesn't exactly have a beautiful mane when it's in its purest form, but he at least assured us that he is not in fact a space alien from the planet 1998 who is here to usher in a whole new era of spiky hair flips and boxy Old Navy sweaters with a single stripe running across the top-middle. That was a serious worry there for a while! No instead last night he washed the goop out and put on his mom's Talbot's vest (so many vests!) and sang us a little song about things. He did well, because it was the kind of old-people-pleasing song that he is destined to sing forever on his 2014 Nursing Homez tour. My friend Sarah has a terrible theory that he will not only get to the top three, but that he could win it. Basically he gets to the final three, Crystal effs up and goes home, and then it's Cousin Phil vs. Little Bear. And Little Bear wins. Sarah has successfully predicted every elimination for weeks now, so I fear this newest augury. Not that I want Fievel to go home. I don't want that. But winning? Shivershudder.\\nI Thought This Was The Top 5...\n...but no one else performed last night.* Huh.

She had reportedly spent much of December begging and badgering the police to take the case seriously and investigate and eventually arrest her attackers. Sadly, those things never happened â€” or they were happening very, very slowly as the police worked to convince her to give up. Well, on Wednesday night she did. She swallowed poison, committing suicide.\\nOf course, that was a drastic enough action to finally make those in power take notice. On Thursday, three attackers were detained â€” two men and a female accomplice. One police officer has been fired and another has also been suspended over their actions in the case. According to the victim's sister, the police encouraged her to take hush money from the attackers or marry one of them.\\nThough this is an extreme case, it has brought the treatment of women in India to the attention of the Western world. According to Sky News, official figures in India state that 228,650 of the 256,329 violent crimes committed in India were perpetrated against women, though the number of unreported cases would certainly pump that figure up even higher.\\nAttitudes and laws are beginning to change there â€” the photo at the top of this post comes from protests over the actions of police. But for many women it's obviously too little and much too late. On Thursday, prime minister Manmohan Singh said that he would introduce new laws to cover attacks on women. In New Delhi, the names, photos and addresses of rapists will be posted online in order to shame them for their crimes. It's a start, and one that should make us ask ourselves if our country is really any better.\\n[UPDATE: Earlier in this post I had lumped two cases of gang-rape together. The victim who committed suicide was attacked during the festival of Diwali in mid-November. The opening sentence now reflects that. The woman who was attacked on a bus in New Delhi is currently hospitalized in Singapore.]\\n[via Sky News, image via Getty]"}

But fear not, GOP: Thirty-five black Republicans are now running for Congress!\\nSomeone at the RNC must have noticed this, because The New York Times' Jennifer Steinhauer is now profiling the poor souls caught between an undying belief in limited federal government and an electorate prone to carrying placards decorated with racial epithets. They might be black, but they're tea baggers, just like you!\\nMany of the candidates are trying to align themselves with the Tea Partiers, insisting that the racial dynamics of that movement have been overblown. Videos taken at some Tea Party rallies show some participants holding up signs with racially inflammatory language...\\nThe black candidates interviewed overwhelmingly called the racist narrative a news media fiction. \"I have been to these rallies, and there are hot dogs and banjos,\" said Mr. West, the candidate in Florida, a retired lieutenant colonel in the Army who served in Afghanistan. \"There is no violence or racism there.\"\\nNope, just banjos, hot dogs, and every once in a while, calling John Lewis the n-word! What do they believe in, these black Republicans?\\nIn many ways, this subset of Republicans is latching on to the basic themes propelling most of their party's campaigns this year - the call for smaller government, less spending and stronger national security - rather than building platforms around social conservatism.\\nIt is not really surprising that there are black conservatives. Anyone can be conservative! But it is surprising that there are black Republicans, given that the Republican party has admittedly spent the last four decades pandering to the bigoted impulses of racists in a desperate attempt to shore up votes. But now that Michael Steele is in charge of the GOP, that's all changed, right? Let's ask Timothy F. Johnson of the conservative Frederick Douglass Foundation:\\nHe added that the candidates might be helped by the presence of Michael Steele, the chairman of the Republican National Committee who is black and ran for the Senate himself in 2006.\\nThat's rightâ€”they might be helped! Meanwhile, none of the black Republicans in the article who are actually running for anything can be quoted saying anything positive about the first black chairman of the Republican party. But that's because he sucks, right? Definitely not because of his strained relationship with party power brokers predicated on his weird honesty about the GOP's utter failure on race."}

Starbucks is doing McDonald's-style value meals, while Tom Colicchio's swanky steak house is halving prices.\\nTom Colicchio, the bald but decidedly un-jolly chef and Top Chef TV judge has turned the front half of his new-ish, poorly-received Craftsteak (he owns a whole chain of branded \"Craft\" restaurants), appropriately located in the Meatpacking District, into something cleverly called Halfsteak. There you can get a variety of meats and other small plates, all for under $15. Plus you can get half a beer for $4! A steal! And there's the added benefit of feeling smug and thrifty compared to those at the back of the restaurant, while they get to feel smug and wealthy as they lazily look at you teetering on a bar stool.\\nColicchio has employed other measures to get butts in seats of late, from special prix fixe tasting room meals to Pay-What-You-Weigh. (That second one might not have actually happened.) Our relatively uniformed guess about this Halfsteak is that it'll be affordable, sure, but pretty cut-rate food not worth fighting the crowds and the long journey to 10th avenue. I mean, doesn't that mean that it's basically a couple of booths floating on the Hudson? Surely there can't be ten avenues!\\nIf you're dying to go, you'd better get in line, as they don't take reservations.

And don't worry, the booze prices will be gay. \"No more $15 drinks!\" Miss Jones promises us. So cheap drinks and costumey sleaze. Just like the last gay-weathered recession some 20 years ago.\\nPlus the boots clamped on the gay nightlife community in this old city by Giulianismâ€”fines for everything from butts on bars to lit candlesâ€”won't be applied so freely anymore. No one has the time or resources to send secret agents out to the latest seedy mope n' grope. The Observer also notes that sales on the \"gay floor\" of Bergdorf Goodman, where designers like McQueen and Sanders reign, has seen sales as steady as ever. \"We can't let [the recession] affect the way we live. I'm a shopper, and most of my gay friends are,\" said one gay that I don't want to be friends with.\\nBut let's not get too ahead of ourselves and ring in the bells of a new gay renaissance. One interviewed gay says he and his pals skip dinner in order to go out for drinks. Another be-underpanted twink says \"I'm like $60,000 in debt from school. I'm fucked anyway.\" A third gay says of his shopping that he and has partner have cut down from $10,000 a month to a lowly $2,000. Which, ouch. Are the gays powering through these very early stages of the Big R because they really aren't affected? Or is this a highly delicate balancing act of desperation, denial, and willful ignorance?\\nI think, more likely, it's an alt-ish weekly looking for a story and stumbling upon some drunk gay dudes and saying \"Hey, wait a minute...\" If the gays really are recession proof, great! They've dual incomes (often times) and no children (again, usually). If they can't make it, no one should be able to.

I mean, when these invincible homos say things like this:\\n\n            \n                The gays are back! The gays are back!

Though the film from which it stems has only been in wide release for less than 48 hours, if what I've heard in private conversations is correct, the Django Moment is already a fairly widespread phenomenon. \\nMy personal Django Moment came when an Australian slaver, played by Tarantino himself, haphazardly threw a bag full of dynamite into a cage of captive blacks before mocking their very real fear that they might be exploded to nothingness. A white man behind me let out a quick trumpet blast of a guffaw, and then fell silent. My face got hot, and my nephew, who was sitting at my right, shifted uncomfortably in his seat. Throughout the film, I'd laughed along with everyone in the theater as a lynch mob of bumbling rednecks planned to slaughter the \"fancypants nigger\" Django, and when the villainous house slave Stephen, played pitch perfectly by Samuel L. Jackson, limped dumbly around his master's plantation, kowtowing to every absurd demand with an acerbic and foulmouthed loyalty. But for whatever reason, the dynamite in the slave cage was a bridge too far for me. What the fuck is he laughing at? I thought, and just like that, the theater went from a place of communal revelry to a battleground.\\nJust so we're clear, I really liked Django Unchained, and there's probably no other movie I'll discuss more with my friendsâ€”and friends of friendsâ€”over dinner in the coming months. I also don't think it's important for everyone in the world to have the same opinions about what is and isn't funny. God forbid, for instance, that Seth MacFarlane were forever allowed to be the one and only arbiter of comedy in the United States. Nevertheless, as Tarantino's latest continues making its bloody cultural ascent, it seems more important to recognize the difference in audience reactions to Django Unchained more so than, say, the difference in audience reactions to Love Actually.\\nDave Chappelle once said that the impetus for him walking away from his hugely successful Comedy Central show was an incident in which he felt like a white employee was laughing maliciously at one of his more racially steeped sketches. \"[S]omebody on the set [who] was white laughed in such a wayâ€”I know the difference of people laughing with me and people laughing at meâ€”and it was the first time I had ever gotten a laugh that I was uncomfortable with,\" Chappelle told Oprah months after he'd quit the show. \"Not just uncomfortable, but like, should I fire this person?\"\\nToday, Django Unchained has me considering, like Chappelle did years ago, what exactly white people are taking away from a film in which a subject like slavery is treated with such whimsy and humor. Was my Django Moment just me being too touchy? And beyond that, did my tittering at some of Django's brutality or Samuel L. Jackson's pathetic moaning cause someone else, black or white, to feel awkward?\\nRelentless and over-the-top violence is a hallmark in most of Tarantino's work, but in Django Unchained, the gore seems different from the director's previous efforts. There is a wide gulf, for instance, between the ultra-bloody kung-fu fights from Kill Bill and the Django scene in which a pack of wild dogs tears apart a defenseless runaway slave. Also difficult to watch is Django's wife, Broomhilda, being whipped for attempting to escape her plantation, and then being branded on the face. Even Tarantino's other recent take on monstrous ethnic oppression, the WWII drama Inglorious Basterds, had but one sceneâ€”the tense openerâ€”that rivaled the hideousness of Django's ugliest moments, made all the uglier because they actually happened.\\nConsidering that some of the real-life, well-documented tortures inflicted upon nonfictional slaves were much worse than the ones shown in Django Unchained, it's almost impossible to not feel self-conscious when Tarantino asks you to rapidly fluctuate between laughing at the ridiculousness of Django's characters and falling silent with shame at the film's authentic historical traumas. It's in this disunity that the Django Moments arise. One moment you're laughing at Mr. Stonesipher's unintelligible bumpkin drawl; next you're wincing as Stonesipher's hounds shred a man limb from limb. (In my theater, one man in front of me scrambled out during this scene and only returned when it was over.) You smile as plantation owner Big Daddy attempts to figure out how to treat a free black man better than a slave but worse than a white person, but then you grimace while watching the vicious slave master Calvin Candie exalt phrenology, the bullshit pseudoscience many racists continue to cite as \"proof\" that blacks are biologically inferior to whites. And since Django runs close to three hours long, at a certain point you start to catch yourself laughing where you shouldn't orâ€”worse, evenâ€”hearing others laughing at something you don't find funny at all. Eventually, you begin to wonder if you're being too sensitive, or if the movie and everyone else around you are insensitive. Then you start to consider whether any of that even matters.\\nThe tradition of gleaning strength from self-deprecation and gallows humor is prevalent in oppressed cultures. Be it Jews or blacks or gays, there is comfort to be found in picking at your own failings and defeats before others get the chance. But Django Unchained inverts the tradition throughout the film: Tarantino is white, and there are few laughs to be had from seeing slaves tortured over and over again. Beyond that, black viewers are themselves offered times to provide their own Django Moments, such as when I cracked up after Django blasts Calvin Candie's feeble, widowed sister in the guts with a revolver, sending her flying out of the frame, or when, directly in earshot of my nephew's white high school classmate, I giggled at Django saying his dream job was to get paid to kill white people.\\nAfter watching Django slaughter every white person in sight, I felt strange as I exited the theater alongside the rest of the mostly white audience. I wanted to pick out the dude who had laughed at the dynamite in the slave cage, but I also hoped nobody had been too put-off by my delight at an unarmed white woman getting more or less executed. Still, the unease I felt walking out was probably my favorite part of Django Unchained: On the one hand, you're unsettled by the behavior of the characters in the film; on the other, you're also unsettled by how you and everyone else in the theater reacted to those characters. Were you laughing with the movie, or was the movie laughing at you?"}

[Click the photo above to enlarge.]\\nDr. Youn's analysis:\\nRupert Murdoch does look a bit more youthful in the more recent photo. I doubt he's had any actual surgery done, since the changes are pretty subtle. His skin looks a bit tighter, smoother, and brighter. A facelift or other actual surgeries would create a much more dramatic change. I believe he may have had a chemical peel, such as a Jessner's Peel, or laser resurfacing treatments, such as the Cynosure Affirm fractionated laser. These treatments cause the skin to look tighter, remove fine lines, and leave no scars.\\nThere you have it: Rupert Murdoch *may* have had his face blasted with caustic chemicals in a hopeless quest to recapture a modicum of his long-dead youth.\\n[Photos via Getty Images]"}

According to Reuters:\\nThe original map listed thousands of pistol permit holders in suburban Westchester and Rockland counties just north of New York City.\\nAlong with an article entitled \"The gun owner next door: What you don't know about the weapons in your neighborhood,\" the map was compiled in response to the December 14 shooting deaths of 26 children and adults in Newtown, Connecticut, editors of the Gannett Corp.-owned newspaper said.\\nThe next batch of names will be permit holders in suburban Putnam County, New York, where the county clerk told the newspaper it is still compiling information.\\nThis, of course, is only the beginning.

She had reportedly spent much of December begging and badgering the police to take the case seriously and investigate and eventually arrest her attackers. Sadly, those things never happened â€” or they were happening very, very slowly as the police worked to convince her to give up. Well, on Wednesday night she did. She swallowed poison, committing suicide.\\nOf course, that was a drastic enough action to finally make those in power take notice. On Thursday, three attackers were detained â€” two men and a female accomplice. One police officer has been fired and another has also been suspended over their actions in the case. According to the victim's sister, the police encouraged her to take hush money from the attackers or marry one of them.\\nThough this is an extreme case, it has brought the treatment of women in India to the attention of the Western world. According to Sky News, official figures in India state that 228,650 of the 256,329 violent crimes committed in India were perpetrated against women, though the number of unreported cases would certainly pump that figure up even higher.\\nAttitudes and laws are beginning to change there â€” the photo at the top of this post comes from protests over the actions of police. But for many women it's obviously too little and much too late. On Thursday, prime minister Manmohan Singh said that he would introduce new laws to cover attacks on women. In New Delhi, the names, photos and addresses of rapists will be posted online in order to shame them for their crimes. It's a start, and one that should make us ask ourselves if our country is really any better.\\n[UPDATE: Earlier in this post I had lumped two cases of gang-rape together. The victim who committed suicide was attacked during the festival of Diwali in mid-November. The opening sentence now reflects that. The woman who was attacked on a bus in New Delhi is currently hospitalized in Singapore.]\\n[via Sky News, image via Getty]"}

His month of hijinks included a mic-throwing incident, a police chase, a smack across the face of a Target employee, and a tearful retirement (and un-retirement) from comedy. His rampage makes 2007 Britney Spears look like child's play.\\nLast night, Williams was held in jail for child endangerment, after LAPD officials found numerous guns and illegal drugs in his house. Katt Williams needs to relax. Here are some things that he can do to chill out for a while and get his life back together.\\nThis week, Williams spent a portion of a comedy show he actually showed up to calling out Jamie Foxx for his role in Quentin Tarentino's Django Unchained. \"They offered me the script,\" said Williams. \"And I said, 'Any niâ€”a that do this deserves to die.' And the next thing I heard, Jamie Foxx was in makeup.\"\\nThis makes him seem jealous and bitter but an even worse moment came when he told the crowd that Jamie Foxx was a closeted homosexual. Williams claimed that Marcus Anthony, an artist on Foxx's record label, is Foxx's secret lover. Offering up information like that as gossip during a standup performance makes him seem like he's losing it. This makes him seem super crazy.\\nWilliams was handcuffed by police outside of a Subway in West Hollywood less than two weeks ago while he was waiting for his manager Suge Knight to get out of a manicure/pedicure (which is a really great image when you think about it). Although he only walked away with a citation for parking too close to a fire hydrant, cops initially confiscated some weed and a gun that he was carrying. He had a medical marijuana card and a permit for the weapon, so they let him go. But c'mon, leave the stuff at home until you're a stable human being.\\nYesterday it was revealed that Williams has been slapped with a lien by the IRS alleging that he has not paid almost $4 million dollars in taxes. If you're going to be a professional crazy person, you need to pay your taxes so these little things can't hold you up. Having permits is all good and fine, but if you're an incredibly unstable person, it's best to leave that stuff at home.\\nHarvey Levin's army of paps seem to have a tracking device on this guy. Right after almost every major incident, TMZ has been there to interview or record Williams being insane. And he seems more than happy to oblige. After his weapons related arrest last night, Williams supplied them with the cringeworthy quote, \"How do you keep kids safe without guns?\"\\nWilliams needs to go hide somewhere for a while, prefereably rehab, or some other place that won't have a lot of guns or weed.\\nKatt, let's get serious here. Most importantly of all, you have to dump your friend/tour manager Suge Knight. He is the most bad-news thing in your life right now. Right after you got out of jail last night, you and Suge went out to the club and got involved in a fight on the sidewalk.\\nYou're more reliable with an AK-47 and ounce of O.G. Kush in your hands than you are hanging around with this guy. Remember, he once (allegedly) dangled Vanilla Ice from a hotel balcony and may or may not have orchestrated the murders of Tupac Shakur and Biggie Smalls. This is the man controlling your life right now. Get rid of him.\\n[Image via Getty]"}

According to Sky News, official figures in India state that 228,650 of the 256,329 violent crimes committed in India were perpetrated against women, though the number of unreported cases would certainly pump that figure up even higher.\\nAttitudes and laws are beginning to change there â€” the photo at the top of this post comes from protests over the actions of police. But for many women it's obviously too little and much too late. On Thursday, prime minister Manmohan Singh said that he would introduce new laws to cover attacks on women. In New Delhi, the names, photos and addresses of rapists will be posted online in order to shame them for their crimes. It's a start, and one that should make us ask ourselves if our country is really any better.\\n[UPDATE: Earlier in this post I had lumped two cases of gang-rape together. The victim who committed suicide was attacked during the festival of Diwali in mid-November. The opening sentence now reflects that. The woman who was attacked on a bus in New Delhi is currently hospitalized in Singapore.]\\n[via Sky News, image via Getty]"}

She's playing one in a movie. Also today: Jane Fonda will be playing herself, the zombie TV show casts another actor, Tony Danza is becoming a high school English teacher, and Twilight newz.\\nTalk about typecasting! Ol' Hanoi Jane Fonda has landed a role in an indie called Peace, Love, and Understading, in which she'll play a \"hippie grandmother\" who lives in Woodstock, NY and reconnects with her daughter, a \"conservative lawyer\" played by Catherine Keener. It's basically a dramatic version of Meet the Fockers. And, you know, wasn't that the first thing you thought when you walked out of that movie? \"It was good, but I'd really like to see a dramatic version of that.\" Well, wish granted. Sure the formidable Teri Polo probably won't be in this one, which is devastating, but you'll at least have the Barbra Streisand character. What a wonderful world we live in sometimes. [THR]\\nZITS AND BOYS AND FEELINGS AND BLUEJEANS ALERT. Summit Entertainment, the entertainment division of heaven, has announced a movie release date for Breaking Dawn, the final installment in the Twilight series of vampire dry-humping erotica. This is the one where they actually fuck. Sources (read: sad friends) tell me that they break the bed! Why couldn't it be called Bad Willy Vampyr and the Break-Bed Fuckin'? You'd still have the word \"break\" in there, which is the whole point, right? Plus lots more '70s-style pimps would see it, and that's a demographic you want. Trust me. Slick Eddie Cullen's Badass Bonin'? Bela Buxom's Dick-Brickin' Revenge? Help me out guys! Oh, anyway, the movie comes out November 2011. [Variety]\\nOh goodness. A&E has announced a new slate of shows currently in development and there are some doozies. There's I'm Heavy which is an Intervention/Hoarders about obese people. Aren't they just hoarding fat inside their bodies? Just put 'em on Hoarders, we don't need a whole show for 'em. Another one is called Strange Days with Bob Saget, and it is a TV series based on the dystopian Kathryn Bigelow movie. Ha ha, I am just kidding. Don't you wish that were true, though? In actuality it's about Bob Saget doing wacky things around the country. It's from a company called \"Tijuana Productions,\" so you know it will be classy. The absolute best one is Teach: Tony Danza which is about Tony Danza teaching high school English in Philadelphia. Not a character played by Tony Danza. Just actual Tony Danza, teaching children. [Deadline]\\nOhh, Walking Dead news! Our favorite show that we haven't seen yet has just cast The Shield actress Laurie Holden as a sniper lady. Frank Darabont, who's directing the show, previously worked with Holden on The Mist. Which, did you guys see that? Like the Director's Cut or whatever? Most hideously depressing ending ever. Pretty enjoyable movie up to that point and then you're just like... aww, farts. And I don't think \"aww, farts\" is the reaction they wanted. There'd better be no \"aww, farts\" in Walking Dead, Darabont. Ohhh, what about Outta the Coffin and Straight Boffin'? Wrong item, I know, but I'm really just trying to help Summit out. [THR]\\nAha. Lindsay Lohan, the girl who used to live down the block but then just disappeared one day, has been cast as old-timey porn star Linda Lovelace in a period biopic. Lovelace is famous for her Oscar-winning (it turned local masturbator Oscar Dewberry into a lifelong fan) turn in Deep Throat. Bill Pullman is going to play Hugh Hefner. Confusingly, Bill Paxton will also be playing Hugh Hefner in the same movie. Or is Paxton playing Pullman playing Hefner? It's confusing. Anyway, good work Lindsay! Playing a porn star is certainly better than the alternative, which is actually being one. (Or marying Oscar Dewberry, who must be well into his 50s by now.) [Variety]\\nCharmer Joel McHale has landed a key role in What's Your Number?, a comedy about Anna Faris digging through her dense sexual history to find the one that got away. Presumably it'll be about two hours of film. The same movie about me would be 30 seconds long and have a completely depressing ending. Not exactly an aww, farts ending, but pretty close. Sigh. Joel, what's your number? [THR]"}

But I dunno. I'm fairly confident we're not done with Jin and Sun. The episode airing the week after next is called \"Why They Died,\" so maybe that has to do with them?

That happened to Wired writer Mat Honan last weekend, when hackers broke into his most important accounts. But it could have probably been prevented if he'd done one thing: Enabled \"two-factor authentication\" on his Gmail account.\\nFirst, go here and enable two-factor authentication before you even read this. I know, two-factor authentication sounds sooooo boring. And it is, compared to the nightmare Honan went through.\\nHonan details his experience at Wired, a Hopscotch of Doom where hackers lept from one of his accounts to the next, burning everything in their wake. The hackers first used information from Honan's Apple iCloud account to break into his Gmail account. They deleted his Gmail account and remotely erased his iPad, iPhone and MacBookâ€”including two years-worth of photos of his daughter. They took over his Twitter account and even briefly accessed the Twitter account of our sister site Gizmodo, where Honan was a staff writer and still had Twitter access.\\nThe scary thing is that hackers never had to crack or guess a single one of Honan's password. They were able to reset all these accounts' passwords by using some fairly ingenious social engineering and publicly available information.\\nThe hackers were aided by flaws in both Apple and Amazon security. But even with this Honan admits \"had I used two-factor authentication for my Google account, it's possible that none of this would have happened.\" See, two-factor authentication requires you to enter a code sent to your phone, via app or text message, in addition to your password when accessing your Gmail account. This means that even if hackers break or, as in Honan's case, reset your password they can't get into your email without also entering the code from your phone. It's like keeping access codes in a suitcase locked to your wrist, nuclear launch code-style.\\nThese days, you need this extra layer of protection. The password as a security measure is broken, as Honan's ordeal shows, and as many smart people have pointed out before (including Honan). It basically doesn't matter how strong your passwords are, if the attacker is even a little dedicated. Thanks to the sheer amount of data out there on each of us, attackers can assemble enough information to bypass them via password reset and other tricks of social engineering.

The 22 schools chosen were the ones with the highest rates of sexually transmitted diseases.\\n\"We believe distributing condoms is part of our obligation to keep students healthy and to remain healthy,\" said school district spokesman Fernando Gallard. \"The health department has described this as a continued epidemic of STDs among teenagers in Philadelphia.\"\nâ€¦\nOf the 130,000 student who have received testing in the last five years, some 6,500 or 5 percent of them have tested positive for diseases including HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.\\nThe condoms will be available to all students unless their parents signed an \"opt out\" form, although, in a move that will surely piss off your Fox News types, the \"opt out\" apparently won't be enforced by the school or its nurses.\\n\"Opt-out letters are to be maintained by the school office,\" Assistant Superintendent Dennis W. Creedon wrote. \"Students are to honor the wishes of their parents. If a student disrespects their guardian's directive, that is an issue of the home.\"\\nFor the most part, the decision has received support from the city's leaders, including Mayor Michael Nutter.\\n\"The reality is: Many of our teenagers, regardless of what adults think, are engaged in sexual activities,\" the mayor said. \"Discussion about whether or not they should be sexually active is an appropriate discussion, but if they are, then we need to make sure they're engaged in safe sexual practices.\"\\nAnd, in case you were wondering, city officials are well aware that kids will use the condoms for activities other than sex. As Dr. Donald F. Schwarz, Philadelphia's health commissioner and deputy mayor for health and opportunity, put it:\\n\"We don't want kids to either not use them - have the dispensers and no one touches them - or to have hundreds of condoms taken and used inappropriately, for water balloons or something like that,\" Schwarz said.\\nSchwartz also told the New York Daily News that \"less than 60 percent\" of high school students reported using condoms during their last sexual encounter, so yeah, the risk of the occasional water balloon fight/letter from an outraged parent seems worth it.\\n[Image via Shutterstock]"}

She had reportedly spent much of December begging and badgering the police to take the case seriously and investigate and eventually arrest her attackers. Sadly, those things never happened â€” or they were happening very, very slowly as the police worked to convince her to give up. Well, on Wednesday night she did. She swallowed poison, committing suicide.\\nOf course, that was a drastic enough action to finally make those in power take notice. On Thursday, three attackers were detained â€” two men and a female accomplice. One police officer has been fired and another has also been suspended over their actions in the case. According to the victim's sister, the police encouraged her to take hush money from the attackers or marry one of them.\\nThough this is an extreme case, it has brought the treatment of women in India to the attention of the Western world. According to Sky News, official figures in India state that 228,650 of the 256,329 violent crimes committed in India were perpetrated against women, though the number of unreported cases would certainly pump that figure up even higher.\\nAttitudes and laws are beginning to change there â€” the photo at the top of this post comes from protests over the actions of police. But for many women it's obviously too little and much too late. On Thursday, prime minister Manmohan Singh said that he would introduce new laws to cover attacks on women. In New Delhi, the names, photos and addresses of rapists will be posted online in order to shame them for their crimes. It's a start, and one that should make us ask ourselves if our country is really any better.\\n[UPDATE: Earlier in this post I had lumped two cases of gang-rape together. The victim who committed suicide was attacked during the festival of Diwali in mid-November. The opening sentence now reflects that. The woman who was attacked on a bus in New Delhi is currently hospitalized in Singapore.]\\n[via Sky News, image via Getty]"}

Leno, on the other handâ€”being the very giant-chinned embodiment of American can-do spiritâ€”simply pushed up his blazer sleeves and wrote his monologues himself.\\nBeing a WGA member, however, this was a direct violation of Guild guidelines, eliciting this terse wrist-slapping from the union: \"A discussion took place today between Jay Leno and the Writers Guild to clarify to him that writing for The Tonight Show constitutes a violation of the Guilds' strike rules.\"\\nNow, one year later, the WGA is still peeved enough to be mulling a disciplinary action against Leno for peddling his stash of strictly contraband Dick Cheney and L.A. weather jokes. Variety reports:\\nIt's understood that the guild has brought disciplinary proceedings against Leno, who is a Writers Guild of America member and writer for his NBC latenighter. The specifics of the proceedings are unclear, but the process should come to a head soon. [...]\\nThat discipline may include \"expulsion or suspension from guild membership, imposition of monetary fines or censure,\" according to the WGA's strike rules. There is also an appeals process.\\nWe suspect this is more symbolic gesture than disciplinary measureâ€”a premonitory, three-day-old carp wrapped in newsprint and left on the hood of one of Leno's old-timey gangster cars, as if to say, \"Congratulations on the 10 p.m. strip, Leno.

Here's a quick guide to America's South Asia Robot War.\\nInitiated during the Bush Administration, and accelerated under Obama, the not-so-secret CIA drone program in Pakistan has killed an estimated 1,300 people, mostly militants, in the last six years. Roughly 30% of those killed were civilians. Using reports from over a dozen news sources from 2004 to present, Peter Bergen and Katherine Tiedemann of the New America Foundation have been keeping tabs on our clandestine war in Pakistan through a report called The Year of the Drone. At first glance, you might think it's a traveler's virtual pin-map of some exotic land. But zoom in and you'll see a multi-colored map of victory, where PredatorÂ© and ReaperÂ© drones blow stuff up with one click of a joystick.\n\\n\\nOne of Pakistan's leading English-language newspapers, Dawn, yesterday reported that Times Square attempted bomber Faisal Shahzad has ties to Pakistani Taliban leader Hakimullah Mehsud â€” a guy we claimed to have killed in a drone strike back in January, but is now reported to be alive. There is no proof yet linking Shahzad and Mehsud. The US killed his brother, former Pakistani Taliban commander Baitullah Mehsud, last year in a drone strike inside the country's tribal areas.\\nThough the taste of revenge is sweet, and a lot of nasty people have been taken out under the program, raining bombs on populated areas from behind a computer screen also presents a moral dilemma and could be undermining America's overall strategy in the region.

Though the film from which it stems has only been in wide release for less than 48 hours, if what I've heard in private conversations is correct, the Django Moment is already a fairly widespread phenomenon. \\nMy personal Django Moment came when an Australian slaver, played by Tarantino himself, haphazardly threw a bag full of dynamite into a cage of captive blacks before mocking their very real fear that they might be exploded to nothingness. A white man behind me let out a quick trumpet blast of a guffaw, and then fell silent. My face got hot, and my nephew, who was sitting at my right, shifted uncomfortably in his seat. Throughout the film, I'd laughed along with everyone in the theater as a lynch mob of bumbling rednecks planned to slaughter the \"fancypants nigger\" Django, and when the villainous house slave Stephen, played pitch perfectly by Samuel L. Jackson, limped dumbly around his master's plantation, kowtowing to every absurd demand with an acerbic and foulmouthed loyalty. But for whatever reason, the dynamite in the slave cage was a bridge too far for me. What the fuck is he laughing at? I thought, and just like that, the theater went from a place of communal revelry to a battleground.\\nJust so we're clear, I really liked Django Unchained, and there's probably no other movie I'll discuss more with my friendsâ€”and friends of friendsâ€”over dinner in the coming months. I also don't think it's important for everyone in the world to have the same opinions about what is and isn't funny. God forbid, for instance, that Seth MacFarlane were forever allowed to be the one and only arbiter of comedy in the United States. Nevertheless, as Tarantino's latest continues making its bloody cultural ascent, it seems more important to recognize the difference in audience reactions to Django Unchained more so than, say, the difference in audience reactions to Love Actually.\\nDave Chappelle once said that the impetus for him walking away from his hugely successful Comedy Central show was an incident in which he felt like a white employee was laughing maliciously at one of his more racially steeped sketches. \"[S]omebody on the set [who] was white laughed in such a wayâ€”I know the difference of people laughing with me and people laughing at meâ€”and it was the first time I had ever gotten a laugh that I was uncomfortable with,\" Chappelle told Oprah months after he'd quit the show. \"Not just uncomfortable, but like, should I fire this person?\"\\nToday, Django Unchained has me considering, like Chappelle did years ago, what exactly white people are taking away from a film in which a subject like slavery is treated with such whimsy and humor. Was my Django Moment just me being too touchy? And beyond that, did my tittering at some of Django's brutality or Samuel L. Jackson's pathetic moaning cause someone else, black or white, to feel awkward?\\nRelentless and over-the-top violence is a hallmark in most of Tarantino's work, but in Django Unchained, the gore seems different from the director's previous efforts. There is a wide gulf, for instance, between the ultra-bloody kung-fu fights from Kill Bill and the Django scene in which a pack of wild dogs tears apart a defenseless runaway slave. Also difficult to watch is Django's wife, Broomhilda, being whipped for attempting to escape her plantation, and then being branded on the face. Even Tarantino's other recent take on monstrous ethnic oppression, the WWII drama Inglorious Basterds, had but one sceneâ€”the tense openerâ€”that rivaled the hideousness of Django's ugliest moments, made all the uglier because they actually happened.\\nConsidering that some of the real-life, well-documented tortures inflicted upon nonfictional slaves were much worse than the ones shown in Django Unchained, it's almost impossible to not feel self-conscious when Tarantino asks you to rapidly fluctuate between laughing at the ridiculousness of Django's characters and falling silent with shame at the film's authentic historical traumas. It's in this disunity that the Django Moments arise. One moment you're laughing at Mr. Stonesipher's unintelligible bumpkin drawl; next you're wincing as Stonesipher's hounds shred a man limb from limb. (In my theater, one man in front of me scrambled out during this scene and only returned when it was over.) You smile as plantation owner Big Daddy attempts to figure out how to treat a free black man better than a slave but worse than a white person, but then you grimace while watching the vicious slave master Calvin Candie exalt phrenology, the bullshit pseudoscience many racists continue to cite as \"proof\" that blacks are biologically inferior to whites. And since Django runs close to three hours long, at a certain point you start to catch yourself laughing where you shouldn't orâ€”worse, evenâ€”hearing others laughing at something you don't find funny at all. Eventually, you begin to wonder if you're being too sensitive, or if the movie and everyone else around you are insensitive. Then you start to consider whether any of that even matters.\\nThe tradition of gleaning strength from self-deprecation and gallows humor is prevalent in oppressed cultures. Be it Jews or blacks or gays, there is comfort to be found in picking at your own failings and defeats before others get the chance. But Django Unchained inverts the tradition throughout the film: Tarantino is white, and there are few laughs to be had from seeing slaves tortured over and over again. Beyond that, black viewers are themselves offered times to provide their own Django Moments, such as when I cracked up after Django blasts Calvin Candie's feeble, widowed sister in the guts with a revolver, sending her flying out of the frame, or when, directly in earshot of my nephew's white high school classmate, I giggled at Django saying his dream job was to get paid to kill white people.\\nAfter watching Django slaughter every white person in sight, I felt strange as I exited the theater alongside the rest of the mostly white audience. I wanted to pick out the dude who had laughed at the dynamite in the slave cage, but I also hoped nobody had been too put-off by my delight at an unarmed white woman getting more or less executed. Still, the unease I felt walking out was probably my favorite part of Django Unchained: On the one hand, you're unsettled by the behavior of the characters in the film; on the other, you're also unsettled by how you and everyone else in the theater reacted to those characters. Were you laughing with the movie, or was the movie laughing at you?"}

Even more frustrating is that she seems to feel so entitled to all of the coverage, good or bad. Her camera-grabbing \"thank you everyone on this show!!! Even the man holding the sound stick!!\" exclamations of joy are soul-sinking. And her whiny, attention-sucking sadsack pleas to Randy, Paula, and new judge Giada De Laurentiis when they entered her empty hotel convention room last night were even worse. She acts like the only person in the room, which makes her merit the attention even less.\\nI know they'll probably get rid of her tonight. That's why they spared her yesterday, so they could do it one-on-four and get the real good closeups of her freaking-out misery. Which, I must admit, I'll enjoy a tad. But it's also just low and exploity and good god, remember when one of these people killed themselves on Paula Abdul's front lawn? So yeah. Most annoying contestant/treatment-of-a-contestant ever.\\nWho's your least favorite so far? And who do you actually, you know, like? I enjoy the dueling pianos guy."}

We're at war there, using flying robots! Here's a quick guide to America's South Asia Robot War.\\nInitiated during the Bush Administration, and accelerated under Obama, the not-so-secret CIA drone program in Pakistan has killed an estimated 1,300 people, mostly militants, in the last six years. Roughly 30% of those killed were civilians. Using reports from over a dozen news sources from 2004 to present, Peter Bergen and Katherine Tiedemann of the New America Foundation have been keeping tabs on our clandestine war in Pakistan through a report called The Year of the Drone. At first glance, you might think it's a traveler's virtual pin-map of some exotic land. But zoom in and you'll see a multi-colored map of victory, where PredatorÂ© and ReaperÂ© drones blow stuff up with one click of a joystick.\n\\n\\nOne of Pakistan's leading English-language newspapers, Dawn, yesterday reported that Times Square attempted bomber Faisal Shahzad has ties to Pakistani Taliban leader Hakimullah Mehsud â€” a guy we claimed to have killed in a drone strike back in January, but is now reported to be alive. There is no proof yet linking Shahzad and Mehsud. The US killed his brother, former Pakistani Taliban commander Baitullah Mehsud, last year in a drone strike inside the country's tribal areas.\\nThough the taste of revenge is sweet, and a lot of nasty people have been taken out under the program, raining bombs on populated areas from behind a computer screen also presents a moral dilemma and could be undermining America's overall strategy in the region. The New Yorker's Jane Mayer covered this last year, here. Below is a chart of deaths caused by drone attacks.\n\\n\\n[Image via, Map and chart via New America Foundation]"}

Vulture charts the steady decline:\\nIn 2002, the top five highest-grossing romantic comedies alone - My Big Fat Greek Wedding, Sweet Home Alabama, Maid in Manhattan, and Two Weeks Notice - collectively took in a whopping $555 million in domestic box office. There were seven rom-coms in the top 100 films of that year, and this septet averaged a $96 million take. In 2008, there were eleven rom-coms in the top 100, with an average domestic gross of $77 million. By 2010, there were fourteen rom-coms in the top 100 highest grossing films - but their average domestic gross had dropped to $53 million. This year the average gross in the top 100 is up a hair to $54 million, but that's based on only four movies that have cracked that list. (Many more did not.)\\nAlso, millenials:\\n[M]any execs...believe that audiences are rejecting these light romances because they are increasingly unrelatable given how dating and courtship have morphed in the 2010s. \"I think it's because the whole entire dating scene has changed,\" says the head of production at one major studio...In America, people have never waited longer to get married. For brides, the median marriage age is 26.5 years, and for grooms it's 28.7 years, according to the Pew Research Center's analysis of 2010 U.S. Census data: For both genders, that's about six years higher than it was 50 years ago.\\nWhat ever shall we do now: Nothing to be done. The hands of the trend clock cannot be moved back. It probably doesn't even have hands. Why would the trend clock be analog? The only movies about love and romance you can expect to see in the future will make mumblecore look like German Expressionism. Flannel 8-tracks will fall in love with the abstract concept of anxiety. Hands will wring themselves for hours on end in high-definition montages.\\nWhat we lost: Indie R&B\nWho took it: Sadsack dudes, pensive gentrifiers\nWhat ever shall we do now: Deal with \"life in the moment,\" listen to \"Losing You\"\\nWhat we lost: Books, coffee, smells, satisfaction, nuzzling, cigarettes, carbon paper, human gatherings, relationships, the little plastic sleeve newspapers come in during bad weather\nWho took it: Hashtags, \"the blogger-Twitter hordes\"\\nKathleen Parker at the Washington Post wants everyone to remember that paper \"is real,\" not like digital devices, which are \"hard and cold to human flesh.\" I know not what terribly warm and liquid books are pulsing and seething against her hands, but I fear them and welcome their disappearance.\\nWhat ever shall we do now: Start watching The Newsroom; smell more things; go back to writing \"e-mail\" with a hyphen; take comfort in the fact that physical book sales just had their strongest week in three years\\nWhat we lost: Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams\nWho took it: The Rt. Rev. Justin Welby, women, gays.\\nIn his final broadcast before his departure, Dr Williams defends his outspoken attacks on successive governments, including his strong opposition to the Iraq war.\\n\"Risking unpopularity, taking the flak, is what archbishops are here for - it is the stuff of the job,\" he says. \"It is something you realise the more you work here, that maybe Britain benefits from having someone to get angry with, and that compared to my predecessors I have got off lightly.\"\\nIn 2008 Dr Williams was widely criticised for suggesting that the adoption of some aspects of Islamic Sharia law in Britain \"seems unavoidable\", although in an interview earlier this year he admitted he had \"failed to find the right words\" and \"succeeded in confusing people\".\\nWhat ever shall we do now: Mourn in ashes and sackcloth. Where will we find the equal of a man who once said \"it is very easy to be despondent about the church\" while leading that very church? After trying and failing one last time to broker an agreement on the status of female bishops, Williams had this to say at the end of his tenure: \"I know that I've, at various points, disappointed both conservatives and liberals...Most of them are quite willing to say so, quite loudly. That's just been a background to almost everything, a pretty steady 'mood music'.\" No pope, no imam, no goateed megachurchian can ever hope to match Rowan's delightfully depressive approach. He and his eyebrows will be missed.\\nWhat we lost: Luxury developments\nWho took it: A.I.G., a deceased Georgian billionaire's estate, disgruntled investors, the Vanderbilts. \"Some brokers fear Fisher Island is missing out on high-priced sales in Miami\" may be the greatest sentence ever written in the English language.\\n\"We have the best moat in the world,\" said Tom Murphy Jr., a resident and chief executive of the Coastal Construction Group.\\nAn aviary on the island houses about a dozen species of birds. A gourmet market sells Russian caviar. The island's day school charges $26,000 a year for tuition and requires children as young as 2 years old to learn Mandarin and Spanish.\\nThe best aviary in the world, bound by the best moat in the world, all lying unused and wasted. Withered trilingual urchins wander the island, desperate to increase their real estate holdings, denied even the smallest condo development.\\nWhat ever shall we do now: Wait and pray. \"Fisher Island Holdings, the developer, is hoping to begin sales of Palazzo del Sol, the next 10-story building in line to be built, by the middle of 2013,\" according to the sales director of Fisher Island Real Estate. Build your own island. Ford the moat and take Fisher by force.\\n[Image via AP]"}

They make less money than any other college graduates they know, their jobs are backbreaking and stressful and impossible to leave at the office, and their career trajectories tend to involve lingering on (or clinging to) the same rung of the corporate ladder for year after frustrating year. And even though teaching a retarded child how to write her own name isn't really so different from working on your average celebrity memoir, that doesn't mean editing qualifies for 'noble calling' status. There must be something that keeps editors from throwing in their red (actually, often blue) pencils, and it can't be the office camaraderie.\\nI know - it must be the authors. The chance to work with great minds - to be an important part of the creative process for some of the most revered thinkers of our time - is such an enormous privilege that it makes any number of other indignities tolerable. Right?\\nUh, maybe, for the gradgrinds who still believe everything they learned at the Columbia Publishing Course. For everyone else, authors are a cross to bear somewhere between 'creepy messenger guy' and 'can't even afford a new coat from H&M\" on the job-dissatisfaction scale. Because, with a few glowing exceptions, authors are the craziest, meanest, strangest, cluelessest people you've ever met.\\nJust in case you ever become one, please remember this tip: Just as you treat the diner waitress respectfully in order to avoid loogies in your coleslaw, it behooves you to make nice with the people on whose enthusiasm the success of your book depends. So don't :\\nâ€¢ suck up to your editor while simultaneously being a dick to her assistant, who's doing all the real work anyway. They'll compare notes, and you won't like the results.\nâ€¢ second-guess or nag, even if you totally know what you're talking about. Run your issues by your agent. If it's necessary to bring them up, she will. If it's not, she'll protect you from yourself.\nâ€¢ make excuses about missing a deadline.\nâ€¢ make excuses about missing a deadline via a 1000 word blog post about the horrors of writer's block.\nâ€¢ offer rebuttals to every one of your editor's suggestions. Either make them, or don't. Your editor doesn't really care which, as long as she doesn't have to hear about it.\nâ€¢ expect your editor or publicist to have an hour to spend on the phone with you every day. Want her to work harder on behalf of your book? Leave her alone, so she can get back to doing so.\nâ€¢ send ten emails with ten different questions in them. Wait until you have ten questions, and then send the email. Or better yet, delete it.\nâ€¢ imagine that your book is the only thing on your editor's plate.\nâ€¢ call constantly fretting about sales in the weeks just after your book has been published.\nâ€¢ call constantly fretting about your Amazon ranking, which you should KNOW is almost completely meaningless.\nâ€¢ call constantly.\nâ€¢ call.\\nSigh. God, why DO editors bother? Must be all those awesome free books.\\nUnsolicited is written by an editor who prefers to stay anonymous in the (probably misguided) hopes of remaining one."}

Powerset tackles it the other way round: They want to parse the English language so the average phrase returns results relevant to it, not to its constituent words.\\nVentureBeat uses the search \"books by children\" as an example. Entered without quotation marks (as most users type it â€” people never learned to use quotes), the phrase gives sketchy Google results.\\nBut it sounds like Powerset's ambitions reach much further than a three-word phrase. Co-founder Barney Pell, says VentureBeat, built a specialized language system that could take queries like \"What were the top five products ordered over the past week?\" and return a table of results.\\nNow, that would be a coup for general search â€” most impressive language systems, including the one Pell built, only work within strict topical boundaries. That's why when Ask.com tried to build a search engine using real questions, they opted to handcraft answers rather than automate the whole process. The load was just too much, and finding the real question among Ask's options was no better than poring through Google results.\\nBut Powerset wants its system to truly understand those phrases. Such an engine would be an artificial intelligence. If the company can pull this off, it has a shot at rescuing the world from speaking Search Grunt.\\nMore on Powerset, the secretive search engine [VentureBeat]"}
